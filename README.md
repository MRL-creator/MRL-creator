# About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm a developer with a passion for building tools, automating workflows, and diving into new technologies.  
I mainly work with **Python**, but I also have experience with **C** and **C#**. I enjoy solving problems and writing clean, efficient code.

## ðŸ›  Skills

I specialize in the following languages and technologies:

- **Python**: Primarily for scripting, backend development, and automation. I love using Python to build simple apps, manage data, and streamline tasks.
- **C**: Focused on low-level programming, learning how systems work under the hood, and enhancing performance in specific areas.
- **C#**: Iâ€™ve worked with C# to build Windows desktop applications and tools. I find its versatility in the .NET ecosystem very powerful.

## ðŸŽ¯ Interests

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me exploring:

- **Building useful tools**: I enjoy creating software that can make daily tasks easier and more efficient.
- **Learning new technologies**: Whether it's a new programming language, framework, or tool, Iâ€™m always excited to learn something new.
- **Optimizing code**: I love finding ways to make my code more efficient and elegant.
- **Exploring system-level programming**: My journey with C and low-level concepts has taught me the importance of understanding how software interacts with hardware.

## ðŸš€ Currently Working On

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on:

- **Deepening my Python expertise**: I'm always learning better ways to write Pythonic code.
- **Exploring C more**: Working with memory management and optimizing code for performance.
- **Developing desktop apps in C#**: Creating intuitive user interfaces and exploring the power of Windows development.

## ðŸ’» Projects

Some of my projects include:

- **Attendance Tracker**: A Python app to track attendance and automate reporting. I use PyQt for the GUI and SQLite for the database.
- **Weather Dashboard**: A simple web app using Python Flask to show real-time weather data, pulled from an external API.
- **Windows Tool (C#)**: A small utility for automating file organization on Windows.

## ðŸŒ± Learning

I am constantly improving my skills by:

- Contributing to open-source projects
